Just released a new Chrome extension **IMX Fee Remover** that removes the 1% Maker and Taker fees on the Immutable X

**You save 1% Fees** always when Buying or Selling on IMX through it

:small_blue_diamond: The extension automatically disables the fees by modifying network requests to remove fee parameters when interacting with Immutable X marketplaces
:small_blue_diamond: You can toggle the fees on/off via the extensions popup window

Check it out on the Chrome Web Store: [chromewebstore.google.com/detail/imx-fee-remover](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/imx-fee-remover/agofgneeldhpjbhjcddflmfiifnbdeog?hl=en&authuser=0)
